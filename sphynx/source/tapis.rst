Tapis CLI
=========

Tapis provide a RESTful API (web-based API) which allows users to securely manage computational workloads on outside resources (remote HPC and Storage resources). The API allows users to transfer files and launch user defined applications at remote sites. The Tapis API was developed at TACC and is highly utilized by DesignSafe to provide NHERI researchers with access to the TACC resources made available through DesignSafe in a secure and managed way.

The Tapis CLI is a human-friendly, scriptable command line interface, implemented in Python, that allows users to interact with Tapis through the command line, and not the browser. 

Tapis CLI provides a unified interface to multiple web service APIs, allowing them to be easily orchestrated and composed into higher-order constructs combining HPC, data management, cloud computing, and other aspects of computing. `Documentation. <https://tapis-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

The following exercices provide much useful information for transferrig files, creating and launchiing applications using the apis cli.
